// The Claude Desktop bundle. A `.mcpb` is a zip carrying a manifest, the
// binaries for every platform it claims, and the licence and README —
// opened in Claude Desktop it installs the server and asks for the OAuth
// client JSON, so nobody has to edit a config file by hand.
//
// It is packed here rather than by the official Node CLI, because this
// repository is Go and only Go: an interpreter `make check` needs is a
// prerequisite nobody declared. A bundle is a deflate zip and Go writes
// those, so the only thing the CLI was really buying was validation of
// the manifest against its published schema.
//
// checkManifest below replaces that, and is not merely a substitute. A
// schema can say the manifest is well formed; it cannot say that
// entry_point names a file that is actually in the bundle, or that a
// platform override points at something that was staged, or that
// ${user_config.x} refers to a key that exists. Those are the failures
// that produce a bundle which packs cleanly and then does nothing when a
// person opens it, and they are checkable only against the staged tree.

// mcpbPlaceholder is the version the COMMITTED manifest carries. The
// real one is written in as the bundle is packed, so a manifest in the
// tree can never be stale: it does not claim a version at all.

// mcpbManifest prints the packaging manifest with a real version in it.
//
// Through a decode and an encode rather than a text substitution,
// because the manifest is JSON and a sed over JSON is how a quote ends
// up inside a string. It refuses a manifest that is not carrying the
// placeholder, so a real version committed by accident fails the build
// instead of shipping under the wrong number.
